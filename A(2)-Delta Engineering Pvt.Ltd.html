    <center><h3>BARBED WIRE</h3></center>Concertian Barbed Wire in roll form is 
    used in high security areas to deter trespassing men and animals. The effectiveness of this metarial
    is provide as it has been in used for more than 75 years suring war and peace.
    <p><b><i>Line Wire:</i></b><br>This is made up of 3.05mm diameter high carbon steel
    wire, with a tensil strength of 170 to 180 kg/mm. The wire is drawn and dresed in such a 
    manner that the coils formed will fall naturally into the specifide diameter without a
    figure eight. Line wire is very hot dipped galvanizedwith minimum inc coating of 185gm/mm</p>
    <p><b><i>Barbed Wire:</i></b><br>This is 2,00mm diameter bright  mild steel wire with a
    tensile strength of 38 to 55kg/mm conforming to BS 1052. The wire is hot dipped galvanized with
    a minimum zinc coating  of 20 to 5gm/mm The barbs are formed with four points. Spacing
    between the centers of the barbs of every 70mm along the length of the wire. The barbs are firmly
    secured by indentations made on the wire, so that the barbs do not rotateor side along the wire
    The four points of the barbs are formed at the right angles to one another and projecs outwards
    approximately 12mm from the center of the wire.</p>
    <p><b><i>Carring Handles:</i></b><br>Handles are made of mild steel wire of 3.55mm
    diameter and are attached tothe outer turn of the coil of each side.</p></
    <center><h3>BARBED TAPES</h3></center>Barbed Tapes are used as psychological
    and physical deterrent against intrusion by personnel and animals. Barbed Tape barrier systems are
    more vicious and difficult to temper with, providing superior perimeter security. Some of the users
    are military installations, nuclear energy sities, maximum security prisons, various petroleum
    installations, tank farms and other important industrial facilities.
    <p><b><i>Short Blade Barbed Tapes (SBBT):</i></b><br> To give the maximum tensile
    strength at the time of the breach hard down steel cord is used (ES1). for camouflage purposes, a
    coaltar coating applied over the entire surface (ES-1), and to attened the high degree of rust
    resistance, the core wire is made of galvanized steel (ES-2). Any of the above three options are
    available to meet your specific requirements. </p>
    <p><b><i>Medium Blade Barbed Tapes (MBBT):</i></b><BR> The specification of the "ivory"
    tape is similar to those of ES types. the blades are sharper and have a greater pricking capacity.
    The life of this tape is more than three times longer than those of ES types. Therefore, "ivory" Tape
    is a more iffective choice in terrian which has heavy rain or in costal areas. The diameter will be
    similar to ES type.</p></font>
