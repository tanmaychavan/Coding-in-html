        <H3>BARBED WIRE</H3>Concertian Barbed Wirein roll form is used in high security areas
        to deter trespassing men and animals. The effectiveness of this material is proved as it has been in
        use for more than 75 years during war and peace.
        <p><b><i>Lined wire</i></b><br>This is made up of 3.05mm diameter high carbon steel
        wire, with a tensile strength of 170 to 180 kg/mm. The wire is drawn and dressed in such a
        mannerthat the coils formed will fall naturally into the specified diameter without forming a
        figure eight. Line wire is heavy hot dipped galvanized with minium zinc coating of 185
        gm//mm.</p>
        <p><b><i>Barbed Wire:</i></b><br>This is 2.00 diameter bright mild steel wire with a
        tensile strength of 380 to 55kg/mm conforming to BS 1052. The wire is dipped galvanized with
        a minimum zinc coating of 20 to 50 gm/mm. the barbs are formed with four points. spacing 
        between the centers of the barrbs in every 70mm along the length of wire. the barbs of frimly
        secured by indentations made on the wire, so that the barbs do not rotate the slide along the wire.
        The four points of the barbs are formed atthe right angles to one another and project outwards
        approximately 12mm from the center of the wire .</p>
        <p><b><i>Carring handels:</i></b><br>Handels are made of mild steel wire of 3.55mm 
        diameter and are attached to the outer turn of the coil on each side.</p><hr>
        <h3>BARBED TAPES</h3>Barbed tapes are used as psychological and physicle deterrent
        against intrusion personnel and animals. Barbed tape barried system are more vicious and
        difficult to temper with, providing superior perimeter security. Some of the users are military 
        installations, nuclear energy sites, maximum-security prisons, virus petrolium installaton, tank
        farms and other important industrial facilities.
        <p><b><i>Short Blade Barbed Tape (SBBT)</i></b><BR>To give the maximum tensile
        strength at the time of the breach hard drawn steel cord is used (ES1). For camouflage purposes, a
        coaltar coating can be applied over the entire surface (ES-1), and toattened the high degree of rust
        resistance, the core wire is made of galvanized steel (ES-2). Any of the above three lines are 
        avilable to meet your specific requirements.</p>
        <p><b><i>Medium Blade Barbed Tape (MBBT)</i></b><BR>The specifications of the
        "ivory" tape is similar to thoseof ES types.Theblades are sharper and have a greater pricking
        capacity. The life of this tape is more than three times longer than thoes ES types. Therefore,
        "ivory" tape is a more effictive choice in terrain which has heavy rain or in coastal areas. The
        diameter  will be similar to ES type. </p>
        <p><b><i>Long Blade Barbed TAPE (LBBT)</i><BR></b>This the more effective
        psychologically and physical deterrent, ever made as a barried obstacle. It is available in authentic 
        stainless steel (SUS 430) and the core wire can be fabricated from either galvanized carbon steel
        or stainless.</p><hr>
